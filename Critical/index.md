# Critical Making
Critical Making can be described as "a mode of materially productive engagement that is intended to bridge the gap between creative, physical, and conceptual exploration" (Ratto, 252).
As I learned in critical-making class, every exercise intended to connect the making process to the theoretical frameworks. This critical course is designed to apply theory to born-digital scholarly practice. These exercise forms include selfies, comics, interactive games, GIFs, artificial intelligence, and generation. Each form can be a convincing medium for comprehending critical problems. This experiential learning tactic promotes compassion and understanding, facilitating students to handle intricate problems and viewpoints within a digital framework. In other words, these exercises allowed me to make and show connections and learn through the process.

For Example, interactive games such as the Bitsy Game supported a complete assessment of critical moments in the past, facilitating the examination of shared norms and the influence of individual agency. Through forming collaborative narratives, I could communicate intricate historical themes and trigger deep reflection on the unified threads of history and the present. By utilizing the capacity of interactive games, we can augment our comprehension of the past and encourage an immersed understanding of the transformative moments that influence the globe. 

## 1: SELFE
As selfie is a part of visual culture, this exercise helps students to explore personal relationships with the act of making and how to make a critical selfie by using digital arts.
Welcome to my selfie exercise:
Traveling is one of the most interesting decisions for all individuals, but traveling to study is different; it means alienation and separation. Separation means being away from your country, family, and close friends for years, but after graduation, you will know it is worth it.
As for the psychological benefits of travel, it can help me explore, learn, and interact with different cultures and traditions. Travel can also help improve self-confidence, independence, and self-reliance, as travel requires the individual to learn how to deal with different circumstances and solve problems and challenges, they may face.
During my long journeys, I took many pictures on airplanes. The selfie picture below was taken during the last trip to the USA in 2023. The total flight duration from Riyadh, KSA, to Washington, DC, is 13 hours. Then, there was a six to seven hours layover at Washington Dallas airport and, finally, one more flight to Orlando. So, the total hours of all the flights is around 22 hours, including tears, back pain, and two weeks of jetlag.
The best thing about the traveling experience was practicing my writing hobby during any flight. Taking selfies during traveling means a lot to me, it means capturing the moment that matter.
Moving to the digital part, I tried to use warm, black, and colorful filters. I also tried to use digital art for some pictus.
