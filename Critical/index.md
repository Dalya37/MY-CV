# Critical Making
Critical Making can be described as "a mode of materially productive engagement that is intended to bridge the gap between creative, physical, and conceptual exploration" (Ratto, 252).
As I learned in critical-making class, every exercise intended to connect the making process to the theoretical frameworks. This critical course is designed to apply theory to born-digital scholarly practice. These exercise forms include selfies, comics, interactive games, GIFs, artificial intelligence, and generation. Each form can be a convincing medium for comprehending critical problems. This experiential learning tactic promotes compassion and understanding, facilitating students to handle intricate problems and viewpoints within a digital framework. In other words, these exercises allowed me to make and show connections and learn through the process.

For Example, interactive games such as the Bitsy Game supported a complete assessment of critical moments in the past, facilitating the examination of shared norms and the influence of individual agency. Through forming collaborative narratives, I could communicate intricate historical themes and trigger deep reflection on the unified threads of history and the present. By utilizing the capacity of interactive games, we can augment our comprehension of the past and encourage an immersed understanding of the transformative moments that influence the globe.
