## ABOUT ME
<!-- blank line -->
My name is Dalya Qasem. A Ph.D. student at the University of Central Florida. I was awarded a master's in Instructional Design & Technology at UCF in 2013. The program added considerable value to my interpersonal skills and career levels, especially in storytelling, digital media, using technology to improve services education, and designing online courses. Previously, I worked as an instructional technology specialist and a supervisor of digital projects in Saudi Arabia with six years of experience. During my time there, I was recognized by employers for my achievements in consultation and research skills. I would build from this experience toward my future career.  My professional goal is to follow the best opportunities to implement degree knowledge, skills, training, and practice using cutting-edge technologies to develop ourselves. Earning Ph.D. degree in T & T program can offer extensive opportunities to understand digital world problems and devise solutions accordingly.- [ABOUT ME](#about-me)
